A node.js powered scrapper ðŸ”¥ that iterates trough all the internal links of the specified url.

It works on CSR pages (React, Angular) with dynamic urls.

Once it is done it generates a ``sitemap.xml`` file with all the urls found, ready to be uploaded to Google Search Console.

#### Usage:

``` bash
$ npx super-simple-sitemap-generator https://vvlog.dev
```

#### Params:

Parameter | type | default | description
--- | --- | --- | --- 
--wait | integer | 1500 | Specify the time (milliseconds) to wait (So the fetches are completed) before starting to parse the page.
--limit | integer | 999999 | Specify the limit of urls to parse before stopping the scrapper.

#### Todo:
* [x] Make it a NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/super-simple-sitemap-generator
* [ ] Make wait time dynamic in response of fetches inside url.
* [ ] New params that lets you specify how deep you want to go inside the url.
* [ ] Integrate it as part of build process of a create-react-app.
* [ ] Clean old code.
